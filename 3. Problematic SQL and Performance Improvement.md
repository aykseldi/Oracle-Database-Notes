# Performance Improvement of a Problematic SQL in ORACLE 11.2.0.4 VT

> There was A serious slowdown in our system and I will explain the steps to solve this step by step.

* First I woluld like to check counts of events. 

```shell
    select event, count (*) from v $ session where status = 'ACTIVE' and type <> ‘BACKGROUND 'group by event order by 1; We ran the query. The result of this query is single block reading with db file sequential read. Single block readings are generally seen when index usage occurs.
 ```

The result of this query is single block reading with db file sequential read. Single block readings are generally seen when index usage occurs.

* When we examine the AWR report, it is seen that SQL, whose SQL ID is fadf88pgsj6tc, takes a long time.

> Also this SQL makes  too much buffer gets . It is even seen that this SQL makes most buffer-get reads than all others  have   done so far.

* Now that we have found the SQL we consider to be problematic, we should find out how its execution plan works;

```shell
set lines 200 pages 200
select * from table (dbms_xplan.display_cursor ('fadf88pgsj6tc');
```
 ![DB](https://github.com/aykseldi/Oracle-Database-Notes/blob/master/awr_report_4.png)

> The result shows us that the running SQL is doing a full table scan while going to some tables.

 ![DB](https://github.com/aykseldi/Oracle-Database-Notes/blob/master/awr_report_sqlprofile.png)

> It appears that a SQL Profile is used for this SQL.

* Also, the query below shows,  how much buffer it gets in each run of the query, how long it runs and how many lines it returns;

```shell
select CHILD_NUMBER, PLAN_HASH_VALUE, BUFFER_GETS / EXECUTIONS, ELAPSED_TIME / EXECUTIONS, ROWS_PROCESSED / EXECUTIONS from v $ sql where sql_id = 'fadf88pgsj6tc';
CHILD_NUMBER PLAN_HASH_VALUE BUFFER_GETS / EXECUTIONS ELAPSED_TIME / EXECUTIONS ROWS_PROCESSED / EXECUTIONS
```

 ![DB](https://github.com/aykseldi/Oracle-Database-Notes/blob/master/awr_report_exec.png)

* It is also necessary to determine whether or not this SQL is using same execution plan while it is executed with the autotrace.

```shell
set lines 200 pages 2000
set autotrace on
```



After that, we write the sql sentence, which we identified above as problematic. (Fadf88pgsj6tc)

 ![DB](https://github.com/aykseldi/Oracle-Database-Notes/blob/master/awr_report_plantable.png)

The result showed us that the execution plan created in the Plan Table is also used here.

In order to stop autotrace,  set autotrace off command was issued.

* We need to find address and hash_value  in order to change the plan it uses.

```shell
select address, hash_value from v $ sqlarea where sql_id = 'fadf88pgsj6tc';

ADDRESS HASH_VALUE
- - - - - - - - - - - - - -
000000034FAD1D00 1602788140
```

Then we run the following command with the values we find. In this way, the SQL we specify  will drop from Shared Pool.


```shell
exec dbms_shared_pool.purge (‘000000034FAD1D00,1602788140 ',' C ');
```
We expect the Optimizer to use the indexes in our tables by using a new execution plan as a result of the operation we have done.


```shell
select CHILD_NUMBER, PLAN_HASH_VALUE, BUFFER_GETS / EXECUTIONS, ELAPSED_TIME / EXECUTIONS, ROWS_PROCESSED / EXECUTIONS from v $ sql where sql_id = 'fadf88pgsj6tc';
```

**Here, let's pay attention to the BUFFER_GETS / EXECUTIONS value and the ELAPSED_TIME / EXECUTIONS values. These values seem to be   same as before. Dropping SQL from Shared Pool did not work because the same execution plan is used even if the hash value has changed. The critical point here, this SQL is using SQl Profile. SQL Profile prevents usage of index  and causes full table scanning.**

![Buffer get](https://github.com/aykseldi/Oracle-Database-Notes/blob/master/awr_report_7.png)

* To see the plan hash value history used by the problematic SQL;


```shell
select distinct (PLAN_HASH_VALUE) from dba_hist_sqlstat where sql_id = 'fadf88pgsj6tc';

PLAN_HASH_VALU to

- - - - - - - -

3186993594

3652799387

3148700412

352594055

3644621806

615129172

3629162104

```

* It is also necessary to delete the SQL Profile used by this SQL. To determine the SQL Profile used by SQL for this;


```shell
select distinct p.name sql_profile_name, s.sql_id from dba_sql_profiles p, DBA_HIST_SQLSTAT s where p.name = s.sql_profile and s.sql_id = 'fadf88pgsj6tc';

NAME SQL_ID

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

SYS_SQLPROF_0167c0834e720000 fadf88pgsj6tc

```

Then we dropped this SQL Profile with the command below.


```shell
exec dbms_sqltune.drop_sql_profile (‘SYS_SQLPROF_0167c0814450000 ');

```

* Again, we rerun our query that we run before to see how much buffer get, elapsed time, how many rows this SQL returned in each run.


```shell
select CHILD_NUMBER, PLAN_HASH_VALUE, BUFFER_GETS / EXECUTIONS, ELAPSED_TIME / EXECUTIONS, ROWS_PROCESSED / EXECUTIONS from v $ sql where sql_id = 'fadf88pgsj6tc';

```
![Exec1](https://github.com/aykseldi/Oracle-Database-Notes/blob/master/awr_report_exec1.png)

While the number of buffer_gets before is 323494.582, it is now 42056.1053. We see that it buffers about 7.6 times less. We also now have one snapshot.

```shell
exec dbms_workload_repository.create_snapshot;
```
Then we created an AWR report and compared it to the old AWR.

```shell
@? 
/ Rdbms / admin / awrrpt
```
The new AWR image is below. When the first one is examined according to elapsed time, it is observed that the problematic SQL working time has decreased significantly.

![Exec1](https://github.com/aykseldi/Oracle-Database-Notes/blob/master/awr_report_5.png)

When we look at the buffer get, it is seen that it has decreased significantly compared to the amount of Buffer Get in the old AWR report.
