#  ORACLE “Enq: SQ - contention” WAIT EVENT AND SOLUTION

> Oracle 12.2.0.2 RAC had a serious slowdown in the 2-node database. I will describe a solution I have done about this.


##  Getting started

* First, it was necessary to look at the events created by the session. So, the I run the following query;

```shell
select event, count (*) from v $ session where status = 'ACTIVE' and type <> ‘BACKGROUND 'group by event order by 1;

EVENT COUNT (*)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
RMAN backup & recovery I / O 4
SQL * Net message from client 2
SQL * Net message to client 3
SQL * Net more data to client 1
acknowledge over PGA limit 4
enq: IV - contention 1
enq: SQ - contention 121 → The problem seems to be caused by this event.
```
 The above output shows us that there are performance problems due to one or more sequences used in the database. 
 
 **Sequences are global database objects and if they are used with nocache in RAC environments, their heavy use can cause serious bottleneck.**
 
 This situation causes serious performance problems. However, using sequences with cache also has some side effects.
 
 For example, if the database is somehow closed, sequences in the cache will disappear and this will create a gap in the data of the relevant column produced by ID or sequence.

* We found the source of the problem but it is necessary to determine which sequence is causing the problem.

In fact, the easiest way to detect this is to get an AWR report. When the performance problem starts in the morning, we can get an AWR report in any two hours of the morning.

* When I examine the insert statement above, it seems that SEQUENCE xxxxxx.SQ_BILGI sequence has been executed too many times.

In order to releive sequence bottleneck  problem in database, I made this sequence cache 100. 

```shell
alter SEQUENCE xxxx.SQ_xxxx INFO CACHE 100;
```

I checked the events again.
 
```shell
select event, count (*) from v $ session where status = 'ACTIVE' and type <> ‘BACKGROUND 'group by event order by 1;
```

But the number of enq: SQ - contention event decreased but not completely fade.

So I increased the cache value to 200. 

```shell
alter SEQUENCE xxxx.SQ_xxxx INFO CACHE 200;
```

Now it seems  the incident that databsae suffered did not come up.

```shell
select event, count (*) from v $ session where status = 'ACTIVE' and type <> ‘BACKGROUND 'group by event order by 1;


EVENT COUNT (*)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
SQL * Net message from client 3
SQL * Net message to client 7
acknowledge over PGA limit 3
buffer busy waits 6

```
